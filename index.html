        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm all about diving into data and making sense of itâ€”whether it's sorting through spreadsheets or uncovering trends, I'm there for it. And when I'm not geeking out over data, you'll probably find me spreading the good word about programming and tech stuff. Teaching others about these topics is my jam, whether it's through workshops or just chatting over coffee.

But hey, I'm not all about that indoor life. Nope, I love heading out into the great outdoors, especially with my fam. We're big on camping, especially in the beautiful landscapes of Colorado. There's just something about sitting around a campfire, roasting marshmallows, and soaking in nature that can't be beaten.
